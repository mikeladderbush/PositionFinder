This is a Project I am working on that will allow users to apply to multiple job positions in large batches while still maintaining the integrity of their resumes. 
The backbone of the project will rely on python and web-scraping to find the positions and apply to them. In the future I hope to create a web and application version
that can be used by anyone at no cost.
